Stilton
What is Stilton? Stilton has a beautiful interior, streaked like marble, and the texture is crumbly and almost soft - relatively delicate 
compared to its stout and bold flavors. Intense and rich, the taste is complex, opening with creamy and nutty specks, 
followed by a salty finish that sticks to your palate.

Blue cheese (or bleu cheese) is semi-soft cheese with a sharp, salty flavor. It is made with cultures of the edible mold Penicillium, 
giving it spots or veins throughout the cheese in shades of blue or green.

The texture is slightly buttery, moist, and a little melty. It's truly a versatile crowd-pleaser. Aged cheddars become more nutty, crumbly, and sharp. 
During the aging process the cheese develops a slightly tangier finish, some earthy notes, and some hard salt-like crystals that add a slight crunch to each bite.

Swiss cheese is sweet, mild, and nuttyâ€”everything an alpine-style cheese should be! When you first pick up a beautiful slice of swiss, you'll notice its 
slightly yellow color and nutty aroma. Upon tasting it, you may appreciate how sweet and smooth swiss is.
